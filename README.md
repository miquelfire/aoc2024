# Miquel Fire's Advent of Code 2024

Just a repo for holding my work for Advent of Code 2024

I used a template from [Replit](https://aoc-templates.util.repl.co/) for the base code so I can run each day's parts easily.

If you're using this, just edit the run command in `index.js` file to use the day you want, then create the input file. Make sure you zero pad the filenames for the first 9 days, so day `3` would have the files `03.txt` and `03.js`.

Due to the rules of the Advent of Code site, there will be no input files in this repo.
